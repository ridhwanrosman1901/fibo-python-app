# Fibonacci Python App

This project is a simple Python application that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive function. The Fibonacci sequence is a well-known sequence in mathematics where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

## Project Overview

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
- `fibonacci(0) = 0`
- `fibonacci(1) = 1`
- `fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)` for `n > 1`

This Python program allows users to input an integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive function.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ridhwanrosman1901/fibo-python-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd fibo-python-app
   ```

3. **Run the Python Script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Enter a Number:**
   - After running the script, you will be prompted to enter an integer.
   - The program will then compute and display the nth Fibonacci number based on your input.

## Example Usage

```
Enter a number: 10
Fibonacci(10) = 55
```
